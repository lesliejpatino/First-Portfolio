    <h2>Hey there, I'm Leslie!</h2>
    <p>  
    B A L A N C E ... a fitting word that describes the <em>why</em> behind most choices that I make. <br>
    I like to think logically as much I like to imagine & create. I love mundane <!-- replace mundane --> tasks as long as they're constantly changing. 
    <br><br>
    A majority of my career has been in event planning and management - two fields which require loads of problem solving, logic, creativity and patience. The key factor that I found missing was that no matter what, there was hardly an objectively correct answer or solution. Ultimately, results were always slightly subjective and I longed for something that provided results that were more black and white, without sacrificing my desire for creative expression.
    <!--
    On a personal note, my happiest moments are spent in nature - either swimming in the ocean, relaxing on the river or playing beach volleyball for hours on end and exploring the world around me.

    Favorite Quote: 
    A quote that she uses as a constant reminder that she is capable of creating life on her terms is by Andrea Balt which says, “Your life is the greatest work of art you’ll ever create.”
